## About Me

I'm @AdamCalleja, a student at Hills Road Sixth Form College. 
I currently study Double Maths, Chemistry and Physics and I am doing an Extended Project Qualification about machine learning. 
I am currently learing about machine learning in Python, but I also want to start learing about web development.
